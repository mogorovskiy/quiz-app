## Overview

Console-based quiz game. Although it can be confidently used, for example, for learning foreign languages.

## Functionalities

1. **Creating a deck**: Allows the creation of collections of cards.
2. **Adding cards to decks**: Enables adding new cards to existing decks.
3. **Play in two modes**: Provides two different game modes for users.
4. **Scoring**: A scoring function also has been implemented. The result is visible at the end of each "round".

## Game Modes

1. **Multiple Choice Mode**:
    - The player is presented with a question and up to four answer options, where only one is correct.

2. **Translation Mode** (e.g. in cases with English):
    - The player is given the opportunity to test their knowledge “in practice” by manually writing the translation of a word. The program then checks the correctness.

## Additional Features

I implemented all the main features and one additional one - using a SQLite database.

## How to Use
1. Open the project in your IDE
2. Just execute. All example quiz are already included into DB, so you can start quizzing.

## Developer Note

Thanks for the interesting test task. I present to you my vision of this project. Also, I've added a database file with initial input data (for testing purposes). It must be said that this is the Minimum Viable Product, which can be expanded in the future. But all the current functionality seemed stable to me.   
Best wishes, Kirill M.
