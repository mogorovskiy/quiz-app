# Dear DataOx!

Thanks for the interesting test task. I present to you my vision of this project. Honestly, I had a good time sitting :). Also, I added a database file with initial input data (for initial testing). It must be said that this is, as they say, the Minimum Working Version, which can be expanded in the future. But all the current functionality seemed stable to me.

## Overview

This application is an implementation of the popular game - quiz! Although it can be confidently used, for example, for learning foreign languages.

## Functionalities

1. **Creating a deck**: Allows the creation of collections of cards.
2. **Adding cards to decks**: Enables adding new cards to existing decks.
3. **Play in two modes**: Provides two different game modes for users.
4. **Scoring**: A scoring function also has been implemented. The result is visible at the end of each "round".

## Game Modes

1. **Multiple Choice Mode**:
    - The player is presented with a question and four answer options, where only one is correct.

2. **Translation Mode** (In cases with English):
    - The player is given the opportunity to test their knowledge “in practice” by manually writing the translation of a word. The program then checks the correctness.

## Additional Features

I implemented all the main features and one additional one - using a database (I took SqLite, worked with it for the first time).

## How to Use
